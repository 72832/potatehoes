# SkyridgeQualityLemonade
Here is code for all skyridge robotics people and teams. If you want to make a team contact me IRL or via email.

Guidlines
-If there is a folder that is not your team IE T-Shirt Cannon don't edit files inside. Please look at them for inspiration though./n
-If you're team doesn't have a folder feel free to create one. Create a file named your team name then put a "/" after it and save a file./n
-This should be a place where people can upload code and enjoy the benifits of git and discord./n
-Make sure to hecking use comments in your code! Thanks /n
